# `r params$workshop_name`

Thanks for attending my sessions at [`r params$organizer_name`](%60r%20params$organizer_url%60). This repo will hold code we write in [`r params$workshop_name`](%60r%20params$workshop_url%60) workshop.

## Setup

For this course you need a recent version of R. Anything greater than 4.0 is good but 4.3 is even better. I also highly recommend using your IDE/code editor of choice. Most people use either [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [R Language Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/r).

After you have R and your favorite editor installed, you should install the packages needed today with the following line of code.

```{r install-packages,eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c(
  'here', 'markdown', 'rmarkdown', 'knitr', 'tidyverse', 'ggthemes', 'ggridges', 
  'tidymodels', 'coefplot', 'glmnet', 'xgboost', 'vip', 'DiagrammeR', 'here', 
  'DBI', 'themis', 'vetiver', 'fable', 'tsibble', 'echarts4r', 'leaflet', 
  'leafgl', 'leafem', 'tictoc'
))
```

## Git

If you are comfortable with git, you can clone this repo and have the project structure.

``` sh
git clone `r glue::glue("https://github.com/{params$github_username}/{params$github_slug}.git")`
```

This includes the `{renv}` lock file, so you can install all the packages with the following R code.

```{r renv-restore,eval=FALSE}
renv::restore()
```

## Docker

If you are having trouble installing R or the packages, but are comfortable with Docker, you can pull the Docker image using the following command in your terminal.

``` sh
docker pull `r glue::glue("jaredlander/{params$image_name}:{params$image_tag}")`
```

You can run the container with the following command which will also mount a folder as a volume for you to use.

``` sh
docker run -it --rm --name rstudio_ml -e PASSWORD=password -e ROOT=true -p 8787:8787 -v $PWD/workshop:/home/rstudio/workshop `r glue::glue("jaredlander/{params$image_name}:{params$image_tag}")`
```

```{sh docker-run,eval=FALSE,echo=FALSE,include=FALSE}
# notes for building the docker image
docker compose build
docker --config ~/.config/docker/dockerhub push jaredlander/odsceast2023:4.2.3
docker compose up
```

Then if you visit port 8787 at the URL for your machine (likely <http://localhost:8787>) then you will have an RStudio interface.

All of the needed R packages will already be installed.

## Codespaces

The Docker image should work natively in [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) so you can run a remote instance of VS Code with all the packages ready to go. You can theoretically even launch RStudio from within the VS Code instance, though I haven't figured that out yet.

To launch Codespaces, first click the green `Code` button at the top of this page.

![Green Code Button](images/github-code-button.png)

Then click where it says `Codespaces` then the green `Create codespaces on main` button.

This will open an instance of VS Code in the browser that will give you R, all the packages and even the code we write during this workshop. You can even attach to this image from VS Code on your own computer.

Be sure to stop the codespace when you are done so you do not get charged.

## RStudio Cloud

If you are still having trouble setting up the project and getting everything installed, sign up for an [RStudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) account, contact the TA and ask for access to the class project.
